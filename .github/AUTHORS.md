# Genstack Project Authors

This file lists the main authors of the Genstack commons, SDK, and related codebase tooling.
Contributors are listed in [CONTRIBUTORS.md][0]; a contributor is considered an _author_ to the
extent their contributions are significant enough to impact copyright considerations. This
determination is left to the discretion of project authors, but typically applies when a full
feature is contributed by a single (or lead) author.

### Robb Walters (@rjwalters)

Robb is the original author of Genstack's rules engine, and maintains that code as well.

### Sam Gammon (@sgammon)

Sam is the original author of Elide, and large slices of Genstack. Sam also maintains release flows
and build tooling.

### Dario Valdespino (@darvld)

Dario is an author of Elide and works primarily on Kotlin code, usually in the SDK or in private
repositories which flow into this one.
