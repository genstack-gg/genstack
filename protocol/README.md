# Genstack Protocol

This directory defines the central [protocol definition][1] for the Genstack ecosystem; well-known objects which move
between code units are typically defined as `message` or `enum` entities.

- [Docs][1] are generated directly from the protocol definition.
- [Buf][0] can be used to [generate SDKs in many different languages](https://buf.build/genstack/protocol/sdks)
